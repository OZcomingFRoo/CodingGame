### There is no Spoon - Episode 1

**Task Description : **

The game is played on a rectangular grid with a given size. Some cells contain power nodes. The rest of the cells are empty.

The goal is to find, when they exist, the horizontal and vertical neighbors of each node.

#### Rules 

To do this, you must find each (x1,y1) coordinates containing a node, and display the (x2,y2) coordinates of **the next node to the right**, and the (x3,y3) coordinates **of the next node to the bottom** within the grid.

**If a neighbor does not exist**, you must output the coordinates -1 -1 instead of (x2,y2) and/or (x3,y3).
